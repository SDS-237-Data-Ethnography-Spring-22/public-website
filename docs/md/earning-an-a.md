Note that to earn a B in this course, I expect all assigned work to be completed on time at a high quality and that students will demonstrate substantial learning growth. In other words, completing all assignments does not guarantee you an A. To earn an A, I expect students to demonstrate considerable work and progress beyond these standard expectations. This means that it won't be possible to passively earn an A in this course; it will require deliberate planning and commitment from the start of the semester. Below are just a few suggestions for ways to demonstrate activity beyond the course's minimum requirements, though you are also welcome to come up with your own:

* Complete enrichment assignments
* Contribute consistently (at least weekly) to the course Slack workspace
* Consistently submit long-form field notes beyond the minimum word count
* Conduct research for the final project beyond the minimum requirements

Note that just completing any these assignments doesn't necessarily guarantee an A. If you wish to earn an A, you need to be able to argue for how this additional work demonstrates outstanding growth along the course's learning dimensions. I encourage students wishing to achieve an A to meet with me early in the semester to strategize.
