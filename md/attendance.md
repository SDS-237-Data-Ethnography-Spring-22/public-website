Classroom discussions and activities will provide you with an opportunity to work through complex concepts and apply and reflect on what you've learned in course readings in collaboration with your colleagues. Attending class is not only supporting your own success in this course, but is also an act of community. I will not be taking attendance in this course, but certain criteria for your final grade can only be demonstrated through regular attendance in classroom discussions, so I expect students to be present when possible. If you are sick, please stay home.
